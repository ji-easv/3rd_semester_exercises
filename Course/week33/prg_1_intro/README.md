We start at 9 o'clock at E0 (upstairs)

### Presentation topics:
- Part 1
    - 3rd semester overview
    - Practical info
- Part II
    - Introduction to .NET & C#
    - Types
    - Making a console application
    - Properties
    - The .NET CLI tool & build system

**Recommended actions:**
- Read (or at least glance oer) the root README.md file for practical info
- Setting up your development environment (check tech from the root README.md )
- Begin your 3rd semester development journey with Exercises_gettingStarted.md ( https://github.com/uldahlalex/3rd_semester_exercises/blob/main/week33/prg_1_intro/Exercises_GettingStarted.md )
- Continue with some basic C# method writing in the calculator exercises (same directory as the getting started exercises)
- If you've finished the Calculator pass-the-unit-test exercises, add the following:
    - Properties along with accessors.
    - Make the calculator a complex class by adding properties of other class types.
- Many tools this semester are "Command-Line-Interface-only". Therefore I recommend installing some terminal emulator capable of running bash shell / similar environment. My recommendations are the following:
    - **Windows:** Git bash (emulation of UNIX environment). If you want a a more full-fledged experience, I recommend installing Windows Subsystem for Linux.
    - **Mac OS:** Terminal (uses zsh; very similar to bash, but technically different)
    - **Linux:** Almost any terminal uses bash


For a very brief bash introduction (100 seconds of your lives), watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4EWvMFj37g&ab_channel=Fireship

You will also use bash scripting / commands when making CI/CD pipelines in Systems Development II, so a bit of practice is good. You should also take a bit of time to learn how to navigate your file system and perform basic actions using a command line interface. This video demonstrates many of the most commonly used commands (he's using Git bash running on Windows): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl7npywCB84&ab_channel=NovelTechMedia





The first bigger project we're working towards, is the week 35 assignment(right after the 2 weeks of coding with me): 
**Creating a full backend application for a web frontend**.
These first two weeks will be packed with C# programming and learning about API building, we we can be well prepared for the week 35 project.


### Relevant documentation, literature & links (high priority reading is in *italics*):
- Download .NET 8: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0 (and also pick an IDE of your choice. 
My personal recommendation is Rider by Jetbrains, which you have a student license for).
