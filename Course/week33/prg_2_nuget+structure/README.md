### Presentation topics:
- Part 1: Structure
    - Project types
    - Solutions (.sln files)
    - Structuring an application
    - Usings and namespaces
    - Nuget package manager
- Part 2: Writing and testing algorithms
    - LINQ
    - NUnit

**Recommended actions:**
- Do exercises for Nuget, Projects & Solutions
- Do the LINQ exercises (Make the NUnit tests pass style) [The hard exercises are by no means necessary, but they can serve as a challenge]
- Do the NUnit + Fluent assertions exercises
