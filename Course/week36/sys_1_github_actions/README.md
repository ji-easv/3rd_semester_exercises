### Presentation topics:
- Automation in software processes
    - And how this relates to the Agile Manifesto
- Modern versus traditional software practices
- Making our very first pipeline with Github Actions
- Practicalities of creating workflows (syntax, yaml format, etc)

**Recommended actions:**
- Make your first pipeline with Github Actions (workflow in yml format)
- If you haven't seen my video on how to write tests and automate these with Github Actions, I suggest watching it (video 3 in my playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL10w4feZfunrIXJWTAtCgwOWCBhezxZlS )
