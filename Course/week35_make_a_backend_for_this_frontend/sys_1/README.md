### Presentation 

Relevant material before project start:
- Frontends from the perspective of a backend-developer.
- Testing Theory:
    - The Test pyramid
    - Agile practice: Test-Driven-Development
- Postman HTTP client test-related stuff:
    - Taking a look at API tests with Postman (specifically the tests for this project)
    - Importing requests from cURL (and from Swagger/OpenAPI to cURL) into Postman
    - Postman Collections (Importing/Exporting from JSON)
    
Note: I will not cover how to write Postman tests, only how to use tests I have supplied you with. We will postpone writing Postman tests until we have covered basic Javascript in Programming II.

**Recommended actions:**
- Start building the backend for the frontend I made. See all the details in the document inside of the week 35 directory in the monorepo on Github.
