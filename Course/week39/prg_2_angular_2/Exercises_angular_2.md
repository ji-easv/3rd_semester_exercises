## Angular II Exercises

Prerequisites: Exercises from last time.

### Exercise: Serve from .NET Web API

#### Task: You must use you .NET backend to serve the *ng build* output - preferably using this Nuget package https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions
*Hint: My video about Angular+Ionic goes over this*

**Success criteria:** Being able to use your Angular application while only having your Web API running. (no *ng serve*)

**Learning objective:** Deployment requires building and then serving your Angular application from an HTTP server - so we cover this, so you can deliver software at the end of the day.
