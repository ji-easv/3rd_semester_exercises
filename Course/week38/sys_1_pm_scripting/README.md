### Presentation topics:
- Scripting with Postman's runtime (based on Nodejs)
- Making assertions with Chai (built into Postman)
- PM Variables & PM Collection Variables
- How to write tests so good you don't have problems sleeping at night with code running in production

We're already familiar with the concept of API testing (and test automation with Github Actions). But what about test formulation using Postman scripting? Now that we're practicing Javascript, it's the perfect time to practice Javascript by writing API Tests in Javascript.

**Recommended actions:**
- Do the "Scripting in Postman" tutorial from Postman Learning Center: https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/intro-to-scripts/
    - Chapters: Scripting in Postman, Writing pre-request scripts, Writing tests, running tests with monitors


### Relevant literature & documentation:
- There's generally a lot of good resources on learning.postman.com, but this one in particular is really good for describing elements in postman's Javascript libraries: https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/postman-sandbox-api-reference/
