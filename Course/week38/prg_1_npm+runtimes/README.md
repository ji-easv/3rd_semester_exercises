### Presentation topics:
- Node package manager
- Runtimes for Javascript

**Recommended actions:**
- Do my Getting Started with Nodejs & npm exercises in this directory.

You can also do the "official" getting started guide here: https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/introduction-to-nodejs/ instead

In any case I think you should start out by installing Node Version Manager (see first exercise in Exercises_npm.md)

### Relevant documentation & literature:
- "Guides" from Nodejs: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides
- About npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm
